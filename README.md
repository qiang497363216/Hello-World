# Hello-World
just testing 
Hi,there,
  this is a note text,just like a readme.
  I am LQ, a freshman in coder all of the world.
  and I will do all my best to learn and study how to coding a better code as possible as I can.
  
  Now, this is the first time to commit in github in my repository branch.
